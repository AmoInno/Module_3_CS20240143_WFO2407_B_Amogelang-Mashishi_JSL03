# [JSL03] Project Submission: Which one is which? Declarative or Imperative?!

Loom Recording Link: [Insert Link]

# Project Overview

In this project, you will be presented with two JavaScript code examples, each demonstrating a different programming paradigm: imperative and declarative. Your task is to analyse these examples and determine which one follows an imperative programming style and which one follows a declarative programming style. 

You will present your reasoning for each example, record your presentation using Loom, and submit your findings along with the Loom recording to the Project Tab on the Learning Management System (LMS).

# Instructions

## Step 1: Clone the Repository

Repo Link: https://github.com/CodeSpace-Academy/Module_3_StudentNo_Classcode_Group_Name-Surname_JSL03

1. Access the provided repository containing the starter code and presentation template.
2. Clone the repository.
3. Open the cloned repository in your preferred code editor.

## Step 2: Analyze the Examples

1. In the cloned repository, you will find two JavaScript code examples labeled "Example 1" and "Example 2."
2. Examine each code example and determine which one follows an imperative programming style and which one follows a declarative programming style.

## Step 3: Record Your Presentation

1. Use Loom (https://www.loom.com/).
2. Create a single video presentation for both examples that include the following:

   - Introduction of the example number.
   - Explanation of whether the example is imperative or declarative.
   - Detailed reasoning for your choice, discussing the code logic and style used in the example.
   - Mention any specific code structures or patterns that align with the chosen programming paradigm.
   
3. Keep each video presentation concise, with a maximum length of 2 minutes for each example. Your total recording time should not exceed 5 minutes.

## Step 4: Insert Loom Links

1. After recording, upload your presentation videos to Loom.
2. Obtain the Loom recording links for the video presentation.
3. Edit the `README.md` file in the cloned repository and insert the Loom recording links.
   
## Step 5: Submit Your Project
1. Commit your changes to the Git repository and push them to your GitHub account.
2. Ensure that the repository is public so that it can be accessed.
3. Submit the GitHub project link (URL) that includes your Loom recording link to the [JSL03] Project Tab on the LMS for evaluation.

# Project Evaluation

Your project will be evaluated based on your ability to:

- Accurately identify and differentiate between imperative and declarative programming styles.
- Provide clear and well-reasoned explanations for your choices.
- Present your findings concisely within the specified time limit.
- Follow the submission instructions accurately.

Follow the steps outlined above to complete the project successfully.

# Presentation Talking Points

Example #: [1]

## Imperative Approach [2 Minutes]
1. **Step-by-Step Explanation:** 
   - Preheating the grill - This step directly instructs the program to set the temperature of the grill to 240 degrees Celsius.
   - Seasoning the steak - This step tells you which seasonings you should use and how to season the steak.
   - Cook the steak - This step makes use of a while loop to ensure that the steak is cooked to the desired doneness. Within the while loop, there are further steps on how to reach the desired doneness, on how to adjust the temperature and how to grill. This is an imperative approach as it describes on how to achieve the goal which is cooking steak.
   - Serve the steak - This step makes use of a conditional statement. It checks whether the steak temperature is greater than or equal to the desired doneness. If it is true, it returns 'Steak is ready to serve!' else it returns 'Steak needs more cooking. This is an imperative approach because this conditional statement dictates what action must be taken based on a condition. It tells you exactly how the program will know when the steak is ready or if it needs more cooking.

Example #: [2]

## Declarative Approach [2 Minutes]
1. **High-Level Process Description:** Explain the code logic in the declarative approach.
   - The grill temperature is defined which is 240. This approach is declarative because the desired outcome is stated without specifying how to achieve it.
   - The desired seasoning is declared as salt and pepper.This approach is declarative because the seasoning that must be used is describe without detailing the process of how the steak should be seasoned.
   - Cooking process - The cooking process steps are outlined in an array and objects which denotes to a declarative approach.
   - The final step is 'Serve the steak'- This again indicates a declarative approach as it clearly states the outcome without specifying how to serve it.

# Learning Outcome [1 Minute]
-I learned to distinguish between imperative and declarative approaches.
- I also learned the specific data structures to be able to identify declarative approach.
I also learned key features such as loops in order for me to identify imperative approach.
